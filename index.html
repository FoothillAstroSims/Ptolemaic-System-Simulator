                    <p>This simulator models the movement of planets around the sun in a simplified Ptolemaic model of the solar system, in which the Earth is motionless near the center.</p>
                    <p>In this system, the sun circles the Earth once per year.  Planets move on a large loop around the Earth - the deferent - and upon a smaller loop called the epicycle.  In this model, the rate of the planet's motion was set to match the average time it took to complete a full cycle through the zodiacal constellations (prograde motion), and the epicycle size and rotation rate were set to match the planet's observed occasional retrograde motion.</p>
                    <p>See how different motion rates and epicycle sizes were used to model the planets' apparent motion across the zodiac (displayed below). </p>
